# Code4ct

In this project I will be rebuilding a website for a  Non-Profit organization "Code4CT" to make it more modern and sleek.


# About the company and expectations for project:

Code4CT is a none profit orginization that empowers young women into the tech insdustry and leverage tech for social inovation so that women can be part of the greater diversity in the African tech industry.
In this project I will be looking at rebuilding their website to make it more modern, sleek, beautiful responsive, interactive and more engaging.
It will help the target market stay longer on the site and hence they will get their message accross of what the orginization stands for

# WHAT's EXPECTED:
```
 - Code4ct (repository name)
 - Well structured folders (imges, graphics etc...)
 - Add READ.me (powerfull and potent)
 - Make sure that you always commit and push changes everytime
 - Website must be responsive
 - Clean and neat
 - sass/css selectors
 - Homepage: banner img, counters, carousel(for the partners logos).
 - About page: team photo's(optimize images properly:no pixelation and should not take long to load, stats counter.
 - Porfolio page: it should hover with a subtle zoom, when you click on the images it should open in "prettyPhoto".
 - Contact page: must have a google map showing the location, a contact form.
 - There should be buttons on the page(button should expand too the right from 100% to 110%).
 - Nav bar: should be static or sticky so when a user scrolls down the page it stays on top add a logo.
 - Back to top button, should have a icon, and it should smooth scroll.
 - Courses page: design the page yourself according to the design on the other page.
    - use object constucter to create courses page.
	- user should be able to click on a course to register("use button").
	- course should add or remove from a basket or cart.
	- the cart should show the number of courses signed up, the duration.
 - Objects are a great tool for programing they can be use to incaptulate information about a particular thing without creating many variables.
 - Methods constructor functions and prototypes, might be the best way to make this page.
